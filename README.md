## What is Mood Moons?
Moon Moons is my Nashville Software School Front-End Capstone Project. This app was built after the first three months of the program, and is single page application created with React JavaScript and JSON-server.

## Problem Statement
"How might I help individuals with anxiety manage their symptoms, track their moods daily, and ultimately discover new coping skills?"

## The Solution
I decided to create a mood-tracking journal with a list of yoga poses, meditations, and breathing exercises. A new user would begin by trying out the different methods and logging how they helped their symptoms. As time passed, the user would see what worked well for them and what didn't, and hopefully, implement these exercises into their daily lives.
